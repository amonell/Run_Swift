# Task 7: Run Session Management - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the RunSessionManager for handling run lifecycle management with support for solo, synchronized, and replay run types. The implementation includes location tracking integration, state persistence, recovery mechanisms, and comprehensive error handling.

## Components Implemented

### 1. RunSessionManager Class
**File:** `Sources/VirtualRunningCompanion/RunSessionManager.swift`

**Key Features:**
- **Run Lifecycle Management**: Start, pause, resume, and end run sessions
- **Multi-type Support**: Solo runs, synchronized runs with friends, and replay runs
- **State Management**: Comprehensive state tracking with proper transitions
- **Location Integration**: Real-time GPS tracking and pace calculation
- **Persistence**: Automatic session saving and recovery capabilities
- **Real-time Sync**: Integration with WebSocket-based synchronization service

**Core Methods:**
- `startRun(type:userId:)` - Initiates a new run session
- `pauseRun()` - Pauses the current session
- `resumeRun()` - Resumes a paused session
- `endRun()` - Completes and saves the session
- `recoverSession()` - Recovers incomplete sessions on app restart

**State Management:**
- `RunSessionState` enum with states: idle, starting, running, paused, ending, completed, error
- Publishers for real-time state and session updates
- Proper state transition validation

### 2. Enhanced RealTimeSyncService
**File:** `Sources/VirtualRunningCompanion/RealTimeSyncService.swift`

**Improvements Made:**
- Fixed `LocationCoordinate` type inconsistency (now uses `LocationCoordinate2D`)
- Added missing data model definitions
- Corrected method signatures to match protocol requirements
- Enhanced error handling and session management

### 3. Enhanced WebSocketClient
**File:** `Sources/VirtualRunningCompanion/WebSocketClient.swift`

**Improvements Made:**
- Updated data models to use consistent `LocationCoordinate2D` type
- Fixed type inconsistencies across the codebase

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite
**File:** `Tests/VirtualRunningCompanionTests/RunSessionManagerTests.swift`

**Test Coverage:**
- **Start Run Tests**: Solo, synchronized, and replay run types
- **State Management**: Pause, resume, and state transitions
- **End Run Tests**: Session completion and data persistence
- **Recovery Tests**: Session recovery after app restart
- **Error Handling**: Invalid state transitions and error conditions
- **Integration Tests**: Location service and sync service integration

**Mock Classes:**
- `MockLocationTrackingService` - Simulates GPS tracking
- `MockRunSessionRepository` - Simulates data persistence
- `MockRealTimeSyncService` - Simulates real-time synchronization

### 5. Core Logic Validation
**File:** `test_run_session_manager.swift`

**Validated Components:**
- State transition logic
- Distance calculation algorithms
- Pace calculation formulas
- Error handling mechanisms
- Route processing logic

## Key Features Implemented

### Run Session Lifecycle
1. **Start Run**: Creates new session with proper initialization
2. **Pause/Resume**: Handles session interruptions with time tracking
3. **End Run**: Calculates final metrics and persists complete session
4. **Recovery**: Restores incomplete sessions after app restart

### Location Tracking Integration
- Real-time GPS coordinate collection
- Pace calculation from location updates
- Route building with coordinate arrays
- Distance calculation using coordinate sequences

### State Persistence
- Automatic session saving during runs
- Periodic data persistence (every 10 location updates)
- Complete session storage on completion
- Recovery of incomplete sessions

### Synchronized Running Support
- WebSocket integration for real-time communication
- Friend session joining and leaving
- Live pace and location broadcasting
- Session coordination with multiple participants

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error types with descriptive messages
- Graceful handling of service failures
- State validation and transition checking
- Recovery from various error conditions

## Requirements Fulfilled

### Requirement 3.1 (Location Tracking)
✅ **Implemented**: Real-time GPS tracking with pace calculation and distance measurement
- Continuous location updates during runs
- Pace calculation from GPS data
- Route recording with coordinate arrays

### Requirement 4.1 (Run Replay)
✅ **Implemented**: Support for replay run type with original run data loading
- Replay run type support in RunSessionManager
- Integration with run history for replay data
- Virtual pacing guidance framework

### Requirement 4.2 (Replay Navigation)
✅ **Implemented**: Framework for route deviation detection and guidance
- Route comparison capabilities
- Location tracking for deviation detection
- Navigation guidance integration points

## Technical Architecture

### Design Patterns Used
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming**: Service protocols for testability
- **Publisher-Subscriber**: Combine framework for reactive updates
- **Repository Pattern**: Data persistence abstraction
- **State Machine**: Proper run session state management

### Dependencies
- **LocationTrackingService**: GPS and pace tracking
- **RunSessionRepository**: Data persistence layer
